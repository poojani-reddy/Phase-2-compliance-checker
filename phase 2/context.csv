Discrepancy: There is a discrepancy regarding the governing law mentioned in the contract.

                              CO-BRANDING AGREEMENT
         THIS CO-BRANDING AGREEMENT (the ""Agreement"") is made as of May 22, 2000
(the ""Effective Date""), by and between WOMEN.COM NETWORKS, INC., a Delaware
corporation having a place of business at 1820 Gateway Drive Suite 150, San
Mateo, CA 94404 (""Women.com""), and EDIETS.COM, INC. , a Delaware corporation,
having its principal place of business at 3467 West Hillsboro Boulevard, Suite
2, Deerfield Beach , Florida 33442 (""eDiets"").
         WHEREAS, eDiets maintains a site on the Internet, currently located at
http://www.eDiets.com (the ""eDiets Site""), that provides personalized diet and
counseling on-line;
         WHEREAS, Women.com maintains sites on the Internet, currently located
at http://www.women.com (the ""Women.com Sites""), that provides an on-line portal
for women, blending content, community, commerce and services;
         WHEREAS, eDiets and Women.com wish to establish and maintain a custom,
category-exclusive, co-branded center containing repackaged content from the
eDiets Site, including a free personal diet profile, which will be a part of the
Women.com Sites, in order to promote the eDiets brand and drive traffic to the
eDiets Site.
         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations and warranties set forth herein, the parties hereby agree as
follows:
1.       THE DIET CENTER.
         1.1 Women.com will name an area, in which eDiets content will be
published (such area, the ""Diet Center""). Links (presented as Diet Center logos)
to the Diet Center will be located on three Women.com channels (the Fitness
Channel www.women.com/fitness; the Health Channel www.women.com/health; and the
Food Channel www.women.com/food) and two subchannels within such channels to be
determined in accordance with Exhibit B hereto. The first page of the Diet
Center (the ""Gateway Page"") will have the look and feel of the Women.com Sites
as specified in Exhibit A hereto. The Diet Center shall be branded with an icon
that includes the eDiets logo. There will be no Women.com or eDiets registration
required to enter and use the Gateway Page of the Diet Center. Women.com and

including the display, appearance and placement of the Diet Center's logo, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including the specifications set
forth on Exhibit A hereto, prior to the launch date of the Diet Center (the
""Launch Date""). eDiets and Women.com shall work together in good faith in order
to implement such design and development and the continued enhancement of the
Diet Center.

Launch Date, eDiets shall include a back button to the Women.com Site on all
pages of the Diet Center beneath the Gateway Page. If at any time during the
Term of this Agreement, eDiets reasonably believes that the inclusion of such
back buttons has a material negative effect upon the rate at which users of the
Diet Center register to become members of eDiets or convert into registered
participants of the services offered by eDiets on the Diet Center (the ""Negative
Effect""), eDiets may conduct a one (1) month test of the effect of such back
buttons which may include the exclusion of the back button. If such test
verifies the Negative Effect of the back button(s) to the Women.com Site, eDiets
may remove any such back buttons.

beneath the Gateway Page. eDiets and Women.com will work together regarding the
on-going design and maintenance of the Diet Center.

responsibilities under this Section 1.

Discrepancy: The 'Governing Law' stated is 'International Law', which is quite broad. It would be more specific and appropriate to define the exact international convention, treaty, or regulations that will govern the contract.
